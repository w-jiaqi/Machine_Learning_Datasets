# apacheApsVar

**Purpose:** Contains the variables used to calculate the Acute Physiology Score (APS) III for patients. APS-III is an established method of summarizing patient severity of illness on admission to the ICU, and is a part of the Acute Physiology Age Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) system of equations for predicting outcomes for ICU patients.

# Important considerations

* Acute Physiology Age Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) consists of a groups of equations used for predicting outcomes in critically ill patients.

* APACHE II, III and IV are based on the APS or acute physiology score (which uses 12 physiologic values), age, and chronic health status within one of 56 disease groups. APACHE II is no longer considered valid due to inadequate case mix index adjustments and over estimates mortality because it is based on models from the 1970s-1980s.

* APS points are assigned based upon the "Worst" values (measurement of the degree of physiologic derangement) that a patient exhibits during the APACHE Day. The "Worst" values tend to be those that are furthest away from the APACHE-defined mid-point.

* APACHE III, introduced in 1991, improved the equation by changing the number and weights of the APS and revising the measurement of chronic health status. The APACHE day refers to the time period in which clinical variables can be used in the algorithms.

* APACHE IVa further improved the equations and has been described as having the highest discrimination of any other adult risk adjustment model (SAPS 3, SOFA, MPM III).

* APACHE defines hospital mortality by an admission. discharge, transfer (ADT) hospital disposition as "expired" or "dead". ICU mortality is defined as a unit dispostion in the ADT system as "expired" or "dead". Some patients will have more than one ICU admission. For each ICU admission the patient will have a disposition of either dead (expired) or alive.

<!-- - Maybe say that APACHE IVa was updated using 2006–2008 patient data (Kramer CCM 2014 DOI: 10.1097/CCM.0b013e3182a66a49) -->

# Detailed description

## apacheApsVarID

## patientHealthSystemStayID
Each row of this table contains a unique patientHealthSystemStayID which represents a single patient’s admission to the hospital. The patientHealthSystemStayID ranges from blank - blank. The ADMISSIONS table can be linked to the PATIENTS table using patientHealthSystemStayID.

## patientUnitStayID
Each row of this table contains a unique patientUnitStayID  which represents a single patient’s admission to the ICU. The patientUnitStayID ranges from blank - blank. It is possible for this table to have duplicate patientHealthSystemStayID, indicating that a single patient had multiple admissions to the ICU. The ADMISSIONS table can be linked to the PATIENTS table using patientHealthSystemStayID.

## dialysis

## eyes

Worst total score ranging from 1-4 with 15 as set point documented in neurologic section under GCS (Glasgow coma scale) in the admission note or nursing flowsheet

## motor

Worst total score ranging from 1-6 with 15 as set point documented in neurologic section under GCS (Glasgow coma scale) in the admission note or nursing flowsheet

## verbal

Worst total score ranging from 1-5 with 15 as set point documented in neurologic section under GCS (Glasgow coma scale) in the admission note or nursing flowsheet

Note for GCS eyes, motor, verbal scores: The GCS is determined based upon the patient's best response in each category during a single examination (highest level of integrated physiologic response). When the three component scores are added, the total Glasgow Coma Score ranges from 3 (worst) to 15 (best). The “worst” GCS in APACHE is the GCS assessment resulting in the lowest total score.

## meds

## urine

total urine output (mL/day) during the first APACHE day with set point of 3000 (mL/day). This value comes from the I&O section of the nursing flow sheet for the first 24 hours in the ICU following admission).
