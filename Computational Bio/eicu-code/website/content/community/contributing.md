# Contributing

The eICU Collaborative Research Database is provided through the work of researchers at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology, Philips Healthcare, and our collaborators. We have limited resources and cannot provide individual support to researchers worldwide. We therefore encourage database users to work together as a community.

## How can I help to improve the website and documentation?

The eICU Collaborative Research Database website and documentation are hosted publicly in GitHub (https://github.com/MIT-LCP/eicu-code/website). 

To raise an issue or to suggest an improvement, please create a new issue at: https://github.com/MIT-eicu/eicu-code/issues

To fix an issue or to contribute new content, please either select the 'Edit this page' item in the left hand menu of the website or [submit a pull request in GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## How can I share code that I have written for the eICU Collaborative Research Database?

We have created a repository on GitHub to hold eICU Collaborative Research Database code: https://github.com/mit-lcp/eicu-code. The structure of the repository will develop over time as new contributions are made.

## How can I highlight an issue relating to the eICU Collaborative Research Database?

If you identify an issue with the eICU Collaborative Research Database (for example, unusual characteristics or limitations), one useful step would be to add your finding to the documentation, via the method described above.

For concerns about errors in the database, including private health information which has not been sufficiently de-identified, please [contact us directly](mailto:phi-report@physionet.org).
