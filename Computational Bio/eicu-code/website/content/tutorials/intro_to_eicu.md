# Introduction to eICU

Prerequisites: *This tutorial assumes that you have an active connection to an instance of eICU running on Postgres.*

## 1. Overview 

This tutorial provides an introduction to the database structure and content. It also provides an idea of the types of information which can be extracted and the complexity of the data contained. By the end of this tutorial you will be able to: 

* Obtain metadata from the various database objects (tables, views, etc). 
* Perform basic queries on a single table. This includes counting the number of rows, and restricting the query to a subset of rows. 
* Perform basic 'joins' to combine tables and extract useful information. 
* Use database 'views' to extract high-level information.
