# Help and support

The eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) is provided through the work of researchers at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology, Philips Healthcare, and [our collaborators](/about/acknowledgments/). We have limited resources and cannot provide individual support to researchers worldwide. 

We therefore encourage eICU-CRD users to work together as a community. Please read [our notes on how to get involved](/community/contributing/) for further information.

## How can I get help with my analysis?

If you are seeking advice for a specific question, we would suggest raising an issue on the [eICU Code Repository](https://github.com/mit-lcp/eicu-code/issues). 

## How do I raise an issue on the eICU Code Repository?

To raise an issue, first navigate to the [eICU Code Repository](https://github.com/mit-lcp/eicu-code/issues). After logging in to GitHub, click "New issue", add a title and description of the problem, and then select the "Submit new issue" button.

Public discussion reaches a larger audience, enables wider discourse, and reduces workload on our laboratory. One exception is where a topic is sensitive, for example relating to patient health information. **If you need to raise a private issue, please contact us using the method noted below.**

# Contact us

Where possible we encourage public discussion via the methods described on the eICU Collaborative Research Database [Community page](/community/contributing/).

The dataset is complex and we understand that there are many open questions, both in terms of the data and its analysis. Public discussion reaches a larger audience, enables wider discourse, and reduces workload on our laboratory. 

One exception is where a topic is sensitive, for example relating to patient health information. If you need to raise a private issue, please [email us](mailto:phi-report@physionet.org).
