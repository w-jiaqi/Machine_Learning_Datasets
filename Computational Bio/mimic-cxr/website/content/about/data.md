# MIMIC-CXR

MIMIC-CXR contains 227,835 imaging studies for 64,588 patients presenting to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Emergency Department between 2011 - 2016. A total of 377,110 images are available in the dataset.
Each imaging study can contain one or more images, usually a frontal view and a lateral view.
Studies are made available with a semi-structured free-text radiology report that describes the radiological findings of the images, written by a practicing radiologist contemporaneously during routine clinical care.
All images and reports have been de-identified to protect patient privacy.

## MIMIC-CXR v2.0.0

The current version of the database is v2.0.0. When referencing this version, we recommend using the full title: MIMIC-CXR v2.0.0.

MIMIC-CXR v2.0.0 is the first release of the images in their native format, DICOM, and the first release of the free-text radiology reports associated with these images. All data has been de-identified prior to release to protect patient privacy.

## Past versions

#### MIMIC-CXR v1.0.0

MIMIC-CXR v1.0.0 was released on 22 January 2019.
The data contains only JPG format images and 14 structured labels extracted from an NLP tool.
As we have reorganized the data since the release of v1.0.0, we no longer distribute v1.0.0.
The images are identical to MIMIC-CXR v2.0.0, and we will make the structured labels available again shortly.
